# Lessons

Gotchas worth carrying forward. Each entry: what bit us (or nearly did), and what we do about it.

## `json.Valid` rejects nil and empty bytes

`encoding/json.Valid(nil)` and `json.Valid([]byte{})` both return `false`. Useful: a single `if !json.Valid(frame)` check covers nil, empty, and malformed bytes — no need for separate length guards. Source: routing-envelope `Marshal` (#1).

## `json.RawMessage` of a JSON `null` is the 4-byte string `"null"`

When unmarshalling `{"frame": null}` into a struct with `Frame json.RawMessage`, the resulting `Frame` is `[]byte("null")` — length 4, *not* zero — so a length-only check treats it as present. If absence-vs-null matters semantically, also compare against `[]byte("null")` explicitly. Source: routing-envelope `Unmarshal` (#1).

## `json.RawMessage` round-trips are byte-stable *modulo whitespace*

`encoding/json` re-encodes `RawMessage` through the outer marshaller and may strip insignificant whitespace. Tests asserting opacity should canonicalise both sides with `json.Compact` before `bytes.Equal`, otherwise they flake on formatting. Source: routing-envelope tests (#1).
