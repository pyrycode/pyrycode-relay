# Lessons

Gotchas worth carrying forward. Each entry: what bit us (or nearly did), and what we do about it.

## `json.Valid` rejects nil and empty bytes

`encoding/json.Valid(nil)` and `json.Valid([]byte{})` both return `false`. Useful: a single `if !json.Valid(frame)` check covers nil, empty, and malformed bytes — no need for separate length guards. Source: routing-envelope `Marshal` (#1).

## `json.RawMessage` of a JSON `null` is the 4-byte string `"null"`

When unmarshalling `{"frame": null}` into a struct with `Frame json.RawMessage`, the resulting `Frame` is `[]byte("null")` — length 4, *not* zero — so a length-only check treats it as present. If absence-vs-null matters semantically, also compare against `[]byte("null")` explicitly. Source: routing-envelope `Unmarshal` (#1).

## `json.RawMessage` round-trips are byte-stable *modulo whitespace*

`encoding/json` re-encodes `RawMessage` through the outer marshaller and may strip insignificant whitespace. Tests asserting opacity should canonicalise both sides with `json.Compact` before `bytes.Equal`, otherwise they flake on formatting. Source: routing-envelope tests (#1).

## Slice swap-and-truncate needs an explicit nil for GC hygiene

Removing an element from `[]Conn` (or any slice of pointer-bearing values) by `slice[i] = slice[len(slice)-1]; slice = slice[:len(slice)-1]` leaves the original last element reachable from the underlying array's spare capacity, pinning whatever it references in memory. Set `slice[len(slice)-1] = nil` *before* re-slicing. Source: `Registry.UnregisterPhone` (#3). Catches: connection handles can be heavy structs; a leaked `Conn` keeps a goroutine and a socket buffer alive.

## Race-test count is a CI-runner knob, not test code

The AC asked for `go test -race -count=20` coverage. `count` belongs on the command line, not as a loop inside the test. `make test` already runs `-race`; document the manual stress invocation in the test's doc comment so future contributors know how to reproduce locally. Source: `TestRegistry_RaceFreedom` (#3).

## A passive registry returns copies, callers do the slow work outside the lock

When a shared map holds connection handles (or anything you'll iterate to do I/O over), the read accessor should allocate and return a fresh copy. Callers can then `Send` / `Close` / fan out without holding the lock — and concurrent mutators don't trip the iteration. The cost is one allocation per call; the benefit is no foot-gun where a slow `Send` blocks every other registry caller. Source: `Registry.PhonesFor` (#3).
